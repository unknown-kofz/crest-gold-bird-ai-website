# 🐦 Bird Chirp Recognition AI — CREST Gold Project

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project identifies bird species based on their chirps using audio classification and machine learning. Developed for a CREST Gold award, it combines AI model training, audio preprocessing, and web-based deployment to support local biodiversity awareness.

The website allows users to upload bird call recordings and receive instant predictions of the species, making it accessible to schools, nature groups, and citizen scientists across the West Midlands.

## 🐦 Target Bird Species — West Midlands Focus

This project focuses on bird species commonly found in the West Midlands region of the UK. The AI model is trained to recognize calls from a diverse range of garden, woodland, and urban birds. Below is a list of species and brief descriptions of their vocalizations:

- **European Robin** – Silvery, crystal-clear song; wistful in winter; often sings at dusk.
- **Blackbird** – Rich, fluty verses; confident and low-pitched; often heard at dawn.
- **Blue Tit** – High-pitched, rapid trills; short and sharp notes.
- **Great Tit** – Repetitive two-note “teacher-teacher” call; loud and clear.
- **Chaffinch** – Fast, descending trill ending in a flourish; cheerful and rhythmic.
- **Song Thrush** – Loud, musical phrases repeated 2–4 times; clear and varied.
- **Goldfinch** – Tinkling, twittering song; often mixed with trills and whistles.
- **Greenfinch** – Nasal, wheezy “dzwee” call; less melodic than goldfinch.
- **Dunnock** – Thin, high-pitched warble; fast and scratchy.
- **Wren** – Loud, complex song for its size; rapid and explosive.
- **Starling** – Mimics other birds; includes whistles, clicks, and buzzes.
- **Jackdaw** – Short, sharp “chak” call; often heard in flocks.
- **Rook** – Harsh, croaking caws; social and noisy.
- **Collared Dove** – Soft, rhythmic cooing: “coo-coo-coo.”
- **Magpie** – Chattering and cackling calls; harsh and varied.
- **Long-tailed Tit** – High-pitched trills and “tsirrup” calls; travels in groups.
- **Coal Tit** – Thin, high-pitched “see-see” notes; quieter than other tits.
- **Nuthatch** – Loud, whistling “twit-twit-twit”; often repeated.
- **Treecreeper** – Faint, high-pitched “tsee” call; hard to hear.
- **Meadow Pipit** – Thin, repetitive chirps; often heard in open fields.
- **Willow Warbler** – Sweet, descending song; soft and flowing.
- **Chiffchaff** – Repetitive “chiff-chaff” notes; simple and rhythmic.

This regional focus supports conservation awareness and makes the website a valuable tool for education and citizen science in the West Midlands.
