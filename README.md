🐦 Bird Chirp Recognition AI — CREST Gold Project
🎯 Project Overview
This project aims to identify bird species based on their chirps using audio classification and machine learning. It was developed as part of a CREST Gold award submission, combining AI model training, audio preprocessing, and app development.

🧠 Team Roles
Chubz – AI Developer Responsible for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and Hugging Face integration.

Toast – App Developer Designed and implemented the user-facing app interface using Gradio.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python (Anaconda environment)

Librosa – Audio preprocessing

PyTorch – Model training

Gradio – Web app interface

Hugging Face – Model experimentation and deployment

VS Code – Development environment

GitHub – Version control and collaboration

### 🐦 Target Bird Species — West Midlands Focus
This project focuses on bird species commonly found in the West Midlands region of the UK. The AI model is trained to recognize chirps from a diverse range of garden, woodland, and urban birds. Below is a list of species and brief descriptions of their vocalizations:

- **European Robin** – Silvery, crystal-clear song; wistful in winter; often sings at dusk.
- **Blackbird** – Rich, fluty verses; confident and low-pitched; often heard at dawn.
- **Blue Tit** – High-pitched, rapid trills; short and sharp notes.
- **Great Tit** – Repetitive two-note “teacher-teacher” call; loud and clear.
- **Chaffinch** – Fast, descending trill ending in a flourish; cheerful and rhythmic.
- **Song Thrush** – Loud, musical phrases repeated 2–4 times; clear and varied.
- **Goldfinch** – Tinkling, twittering song; often mixed with trills and whistles.
- **Greenfinch** – Nasal, wheezy “dzwee” call; less melodic than goldfinch.
- **Dunnock** – Thin, high-pitched warble; fast and scratchy.
- **Wren** – Loud, complex song for its size; rapid and explosive.
- **Starling** – Mimics other birds; includes whistles, clicks, and buzzes.
- **Jackdaw** – Short, sharp “chak” call; often heard in flocks.
- **Rook** – Harsh, croaking caws; social and noisy.
- **Collared Dove** – Soft, rhythmic cooing: “coo-coo-coo.”
- **Magpie** – Chattering and cackling calls; harsh and varied.
- maybe - **Long-tailed Tit** – High-pitched trills and “tsirrup” calls; travels in groups.
- **Coal Tit** – Thin, high-pitched “see-see” notes; quieter than other tits.
- **Nuthatch**(commonly known as Nuthatch in the UK) – Loud, whistling “twit-twit-twit”; often repeated.
- **Treecreeper** – Faint, high-pitched “tsee” call; hard to hear.
- **Meadow Pipit** – Thin, repetitive chirps; often heard in open fields.
- **Willow Warbler** – Sweet, descending song; soft and flowing.
- **Chiffchaff** – Repetitive “chiff-chaff” notes; simple and rhythmic.
- **Pied Wagtail** – Sharp “tsweep” call; often heard while flying.

This regional focus supports local conservation awareness and makes the app useful for schools, nature groups, and citizen science initiatives across the West Midlands.
